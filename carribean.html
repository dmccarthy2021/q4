	<h1>More About the Carribean!</h1>
		<h2>Anguilla</h2>
			<p>Anguilla is that proverbial Caribbean dream come true. An idyllic destination with white-sand beaches fringed with coconut palms. Sizzling BBQs accompanied by exquisite cocktails. And warm aquamarine waters, perhaps some of the most inviting in the Caribbean. When you’re not "liming," a local term that means "hanging out and relaxing with friends," Anguilla offers a host of activities from snorkeling and sailing to fishing and quad biking. The good life extends to its many open-air restaurants and gorgeous resorts. Your Liberty Travel consultant can plan a vacation package that suits you best.</p>
		<h2>Aruba</h2>
			<p>If you’re looking for more days of sunshine on your vacation, Aruba is the island for you (with more sunny days than any other Caribbean island). It lies outside the hurricane belt, meaning it isn’t often impacted by hurricane season. Its small size makes it easy to explore. Soak on a white-sand beach in the morning, explore a rugged desert before lunch, browse the colorful Dutch shops of Oranjestad in the afternoon, and enjoy a snorkel before the sun sets. Your Liberty Travel consultant can connect you with a sun-filled luxury or all-inclusive Aruba vacation package.</p>
		<h2>Dominican Republic</h2>
			<p>The Dominican Republic boasts 1000 miles of coastline and cities as unique as the landscape. Sip a Caribbean rum punch on the white sands of an exclusive Punta Cana resort. Travel to the protected bay of Samaná, where thousands of humpback whales mate in the winter. Splash around in Samaná’s waterfalls surrounded by lush tropical plants. Soak in the sunshine on the shores of Puerto Plata at the foot of Mount Isabel de Torres. From the rolling countryside of the interior, to the turquoise waters of the coast, the DR brings days of sunshine and nights of merengue. Liberty Travel can take you there.</p>
		<h2>Puerto Rico</h2>
			<p>Puerto Rico offers a distinctive blend of Spanish, European, native, and American culture. Trade wind breezes temper the Caribbean sun, and natural marvels abound. Whether you’re strolling San Juan’s old world-style streets, discovering its 500-year-old San Felipe del Morro citadel, or partying the night away at San Juan’s clubs and casinos, there’s a little something for everyone. Puerto Rico offers world-class beaches, fishing, surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, and more—so whatever you’re looking for, your Liberty Travel consultant can create a vacation that fits your style.</p>
		<h2>Turks and Caicos</h2>
			<p>The hidden gems of the Caribbean, the Turks and Caicos Islands are tucked away at the southern tip of the Bahamian Archipelago, eluding the radar of most travelers. This only means one thing: without the typical vacationing crowds, there’s more of the islands for you to enjoy. With over 230 miles of white-sand beaches, crystal-clear waters full of marine life (it’s the world’s third-largest barrier reef), luxury resorts, miles of swimmable water and perfect vacation weather, these stunningly beautiful islands will leave you wanting more.</p>
		<h2>Jamaica</h2>
			<p>Jamaica’s culture, music scene, cuisine, waterfalls, and beach resorts offer a little something for everyone. Experience the luxury and shopping of Ocho Rios, and soak in the wading pools of Dunn’s River Falls. Visit Kingston, which gave the world Usain Bolt and Bob Marley. Relax on a white-sand beach in Montego Bay, or drift down a river. Spend days in the sun, snorkeling, swimming, or paddling, and then dance the night away to reggae and dancehall. Make friends with a Rastafarian, or visit Kingston’s museums and galleries. Discover Jamaica with Liberty Travel’s consultants.</p>
		<h2>U.S. Virgin Islands</h2>
			<p>Surrounded by the Atlantic and the Caribbean, St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas each have their own identities, but together they are home to some of the most beautiful beaches and breathtaking landscapes in the world. St. Croix, the largest island, is known for its colorful carnivals and world-class golf courses. While two thirds of St. John consists of a national park and sublime beaches. And the historic capital, St. Thomas, is loaded with Caribbean charm. The best part, our Liberty Travel consultants can customize your vacation package, so you can enjoy them all.</p>
