			<h2>Europe!</h2>
				<img src="images/europe.jpg" class="right img2">
				<p>European countries welcome almost a half-billion international visitors per year. Not only is it the most popular destination for Americans traveling overseas, it’s also the easiest, thanks to: an open borders policy, efficient travel infrastructure, and a common currency, Euro (€) in most of the individual countries. Traveling to Europe is quite simple for American citizens as a visa is not required for countries of the European Union and/or the 26 countries that fall under the Schengen Area (your Liberty Travel consultant will be happy to assist you with this). Once you land in any of these countries, your passport is stamped, leaving you free to travel across borders—so you can go from London to Paris to Netherlands seamlessly. Trains, budget airlines, and cars are the most popular ways to travel around this beautiful continent. <a href="europe.html" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>
