		<div class="c3"> <h1 class="web">Bio</h1> <p> My name is Drew and I go to St. Joseph's Catholic School in South Carolina. I play baseball for the varsity team, and I play outfield and pitcher. Outside of school I like to hang out with my friends and I also like to play video games. My family also goes to the lake, so I love to do water sports like wakeboarding and skiing. </p>
