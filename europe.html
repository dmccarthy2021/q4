	<h1>More About Europe!</h1>
		<h2>England</h2>
			<p>Welcome to England. A land steeped in history, royalty, and culture. Head over to London’s most vibrant, cosmopolitan streets. Marvel at the wonder of Stonehenge. Explore Leeds Castle or spend an idyllic day on the south coast by Brighton Beach. Take a tour to the rolling countryside and charismatic villages. No matter which vacation package you choose, one thing’s certain, you will leave smitten by England’s charm.</p>
		<h2>Iceland</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Iceland. Nothing will compare to what you’ll experience in this little country at the edge of the Earth. Iceland has some of the best things to do, whether it’s a tour of the greatest hits (Northern Lights, Geysir, the Blue Lagoon) or its best kept secrets—think glaciers, lava fields, national parks—our Liberty Travel consultants can suggest a vacation package with plenty of "is this for real?" moments.</p>
		<h2>Greece</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Greece. Where the water and sky are spectacular shades of crystal blue, the sun-bleached ruins are reminders of ancient heroes and history, and the cobblestone streets filled with music and local cuisine are an introduction to a culture that’s rich in tradition. Whether you choose to explore the stunning islands, visit the historic sites, or enjoy modern Greece, our Liberty Travel consultants can customize your Greek vacation package with just the right tours to make your trip legendary.</p>
		<h2>Portugal</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Portugal. You are about to discover a remarkably diverse destination. Whether you’re looking for a CITYbreak in Lisbon, some medieval history in Porto, a coastline of golden beaches, or a culture of fun and festivities…Portugal is your place. This little country on the western edge of Europe offers a unique blend of old-world charm and new-world cool, and our Liberty Travel consultants can create a Portugal vacation package with the perfect trips and tours so you can enjoy the best of Portugal's many delights.</p>
		<h2>Spain</h2>
			<p>The land of Gaudí, Picasso, and Dalí. Mediterranean beaches. The Alcázar and the Great Mosque of Córdoba. The snow-capped Sierra Nevada. The flavor of Spain can be tasted in its tapas, felt in its flamenco, and experienced through its fiestas. The country is a blend of cultures, from its unique Basque region to its Muslim-influenced south. Spain’s cosmopolitan cities exude an elegance all their own, from Madrid’s Prado to Gaudí’s Barcelona—there’s an essence to Spain that can only be captured by being there—and Liberty Travel’s consultants can help you experience it. </p>
		<h2>Italy</h2>
			<p>Language and culture, food and fashion, art and architecture, history and myths…all fill your senses as you set foot in bella Italia. Whether it’s the gondola rides and soft sunsets at Venice, the sweeping landscape and vineyards in Tuscany or the iconic larger-than-life sites in Rome—Italy invites you to slow down and soak it all in. Something that your Liberty Travel consultant keeps in mind when customizing your vacation package with just the right CITYbreak or tour, so it can be one to remember.</p>
		<h2>Ireland</h2>
			<p>From emerald green glens to literary Dublin, Ireland offers days of culture and nature, toasted with a glass of Guinness. Dublin is wonderfully walkable. Take a day stroll to Trinity College, tour the Guinness Storehouse, and end your day with another glass at a pub. Celebrate your own Bloomsday (in honor of Leopold Bloom, the main character of James Joyce’s celebrated Irish novel, Ulysses), exploring the city’s literary landmarks. Liberty Travel’s consultants can help you venture outside the city to the countryside’s spectacular cliffs and hidden music bars echoing with traditional Irish tunes.</p>
